# Snakes and Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a board game based on chance. The player must navigate from the start of the board to the final square. The player can move forward a fixed number of squares based on the outcome of a single die roll. Along the path are a fixed number of snakes and ladders. If a player moves to a space with a ladder they can move directly forward to the space at the other side of the ladder. This brings them closer to the final square. If a player moves to a space with a snake they must move directly back to the space at the other side of the snake. This brings them further away from the final square.
